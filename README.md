# Breast Cancer Prediction

Objective: 

The goal is to classify whether a breast cancer is Malignant or Benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29).

This analysis also aims to observes which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that may aid us in model selection and hyper parameter selection. 

Here, following Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models are applied to predict the category of the Breast-Cancer.

* Logistic Regression
* Nearest Neighbor
* Support Vector Machines
* Kernel SVM
* Grid Search CV
* Naïve Bayes
* Decision Tree Algorithm
* Random Forest Classification
* Tensorflow Keras API Dense layer
